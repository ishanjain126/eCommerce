# eCommerce
Ecommerce Capstone Project
This repo contains two folders: eCommerce-front and final. eCommerce-front is the front end, and final is the backend of the respective application - eCommerce app (Undecided).

**NOTE**
To run the project: npm install
then npm start(both backend and frontend)
Also, install monogdb, robo 3T(to go through the mongo database), postman (to check backend functionality). 
You wont be seeing anything on the site as data is stored on my computer (locally). Have to see how to connect atlas. 
Apart from the UI related changes dont push any other change. 


Basic definitions

Callback function & Higher Order Function:

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be “called back” at a later time. A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the callback function gets executed.
